# company-research

Fetches official company filings — annual reports, AGM documents, regulatory announcements — from
public sources and makes them available to an AI client. Works as an MCP server (for agents with
MCP support) or as a standalone CLI tool (for direct Bash invocations or scripting).

## Current Coverage

- UK companies via Companies House

## Installation

**Download a pre-built binary** (no Go required):

Download the latest release for your platform from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/riftwerx/company-research/releases/latest),
extract the archive, and place the binary on your `$PATH`.

**Install via `go install`:**

```bash
go install github.com/riftwerx/company-research/cmd/company-research@latest
```

**Or build from source** (installs to `$GOPATH/bin`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riftwerx/company-research
cd company-research
make local-release
```

> `make` targets require a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows).
> Windows users without WSL can run `go install ./cmd/company-research` directly —
> the binary is fully Windows-compatible; only the build tooling requires Unix.

The binary is named `company-research`. Ensure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is on your `$PATH`.

Verify the installation:

```bash
company-research --version
```

## Upgrading from v0.3.x

The binary was renamed from `company-research-mcp` to `company-research` after v0.3.0. After installing the new binary, remove the old one and update your MCP client config:

**`go install` users:**

```bash
rm "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/company-research-mcp"
```

**Pre-built binary users:** delete the old `company-research-mcp` binary from wherever you placed it on your `$PATH`.

Then update the `command:` field in your MCP client config from `company-research-mcp` to `company-research`.

**Migrate your cache** (optional — skipping means cached filings are re-downloaded on next use):

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Linux | `mv ~/.cache/company-research.mcp ~/.cache/company-research` |
| macOS | `mv ~/Library/Caches/company-research.mcp ~/Library/Caches/company-research` |
| Windows | `Rename-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\company-research.mcp" company-research` |

## Client Configuration

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio company-research \
  --scope user \
  --env CH_API_KEY=your-key-here \
  -- company-research
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "company-research": {
      "command": "company-research",
      "env": {
        "CH_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "company-research": {
      "command": "company-research",
      "env": {
        "CH_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "company-research": {
      "command": "company-research",
      "env": {
        "CH_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Continue.dev

Add to `~/.continue/config.json` under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "company-research",
      "command": "company-research",
      "env": {
        "CH_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## CLI Mode

The binary can also be used directly from the shell or from an agent's Bash tool — useful for
scripting or for agents that prefer direct invocations over MCP tool calls.

```bash
export CH_API_KEY=your-key-here

company-research search-company "Tesco"
company-research get-latest 00445790 accounts
company-research get-company-profile 00445790 | jq .name
```

All commands output JSON to stdout; errors go to stderr with exit 1. Run
`company-research --help` for a full list of subcommands and flags.

## Agent Skills

Install embedded skill files to give your AI agent workflow knowledge for using
company-research effectively. No `CH_API_KEY` required.

### Claude Code

```bash
company-research install-skill ~/.claude/skills/
```

Installs both the MCP skill and the CLI skill. To install only one:

```bash
company-research install-skill --mcp ~/.claude/skills/   # MCP mode only
company-research install-skill --cli ~/.claude/skills/   # CLI mode only
```

### Other agents

Check your agent's documentation for its skill or custom-prompt directory, then:

```bash
company-research install-skill <agent-skill-directory>
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_company` | Search for UK companies by name |
| `get_company_profile` | Get a company profile by Companies House number |
| `list_filings` | List filing history for a company; returns a `document_id` for each filing (filings without a downloadable document are excluded) |
| `fetch_filing` | Download a specific filing document using the `document_id` from `list_filings` |
| `get_latest` | Fetch the most recent filing of a given category; returns a `document_id` alongside the local path |
| `list_zip_contents` | List all documents extracted from a zip archive filing; use when `fetch_filing` or `get_latest` returns `is_archive: true` |
| `extract_xbrl_facts` | Parse a cached iXBRL `.xhtml` file and return structured financial facts as JSON; also reports whether the document is native iXBRL or PDF-rendered |
| `clear_cache` | Delete cached filing documents |

### Document formats

Filings are returned as **PDF** or **iXBRL** (`.xhtml`) depending on what Companies House provides.

When a filing is served as a zip archive, all documents are extracted and the primary document is
selected automatically. The `fetch_filing` / `get_latest` response will include `is_archive: true`
alongside `local_path` and `document_id` for the primary file. Call `list_zip_contents` with the
same `ch_number` and `document_id` to get the full manifest — each entry has its own `local_path`,
`content_type`, and `is_primary` flag, so secondary documents (e.g. a PDF companion alongside an
iXBRL) can be accessed directly. When an archive contains more than 20 files, `truncated: true` is
set and `total_in_archive` shows the full count.

### Extracting financial data from iXBRL filings

When `fetch_filing` or `get_latest` returns `content_type: application/xhtml+xml`, the file is an
iXBRL document containing tagged financial data. Use `extract_xbrl_facts` to parse it:

```
extract_xbrl_facts(local_path=<path from fetch_filing>)
```

Returns `{facts, count, truncated, render_type, warnings?}`. Each fact has `name`, `value`,
`period`, and `unit`. When `truncated` is `true` the document contained more than 2,000 facts —
use `name_prefix` to narrow the query (e.g. `name_prefix="Revenue"` returns only Revenue-related
facts).

`render_type` is `"native_ixbrl"` for standard filings or `"pdf_rendered"` for filings produced
by a PDF-to-HTML converter (e.g. `pdf2htmlEX`). PDF-rendered filings have fully extractable XBRL
facts but fragmented narrative text (MD&A, notes); when detected a `warnings` array explains this
and the document will not be readable as prose. If the filing came from a zip archive, the warning
also names any alternative formats available (e.g. a PDF) and directs you to use `list_zip_contents`
to access them.

### Local cache

Downloaded filings are stored on disk and reused on subsequent requests:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.cache/company-research.mcp/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Caches/company-research.mcp/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\company-research.mcp\` |

Use the `clear_cache` tool to free disk space.
